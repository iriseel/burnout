                Is Your Pursuit of the "Good Life" through Repetitive White-Collar Labor Making Your Life Bad, Actually?

            <p>
                When I first started making this site, one text in particular weighed heavy on my mind: scholar Lauren Berlant's "Slow Death (Sovereignty, Obesity, Lateral Agency)." In this 2007 article, Berlant sketched out a phenomenon they termed "slow death" — the mass physical wearing out of working-class (as well as poc and aged) bodies by capitalism in spaces of production and in the rest of life.</p>
            
            <p>
                "While death is usually deemed an event in contrast to life’s 'extensivity,'" in the domain of slow death "dying and the ordinary reproduction of life are coextensive." Owing to conditions of diet, labor, environment, and more, the lives of vulnerable populations are shortened at the same time as temporality speeds up under capitalism. "[M]orbidity, the embodiment towards death as a way of life, marks out slow death as what there is of the good life for the vast majority of American workers."
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In comparison, burnout comes across as an almost benignly white-collar variety of slow death. Distinctions abound between immaterial and material labor, productivity and production, livelihood and life. Even as the intensifying conflation of work and home troubles the distinction, theoretically at least, burnout is meant to be a condition to be left at the workplace, as opposed to the all-permeating condition of slow death. But I nonetheless approached the subject of burnout with slow death on my mind, and in so doing found myself thinking most about (micro-)scales of time as a body incrementally frays against capitalist pace, physiologies of stress, the fine attunements our bodies make to become appendages of our respective machines, and the small repetitive-compulsive gestures and flatness of affect that make up various (literal) postures of capitalism in its different historical stages.

            <p>
                These concerns led me to a medley of multimedia materials, which are grouped thematically below.

                1. This article about a design intern who developed debilitating arm pain after "using my middle finger to zoom in and zoom out all the time in this 3-D design program. Basically, the whole summer I was using one finger." Yet without any seeming criticism of the work demands that demobilized her, said intern Michelle instead pivoted to drawing on a trackpad with her nose: “I’ll still put in the same long hours, but I’ll just do it with my nose, and the nosepad, as I call it.” Her story is meant to be inspirational, somehow: “I want to tell other people that have the same problem and might think their jobs are in jeopardy that no, it doesn’t have to mean that. There are different ways of interacting with a computer. A mouse isn’t the only way.”

            <p>
                FRIDAY, June 23, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- People who spend lots of time on their <span class="object">smartphones</span> may be <span class="verb">scrolling</span>, <span class="verb">tapping</span> and <span class="verb">swiping</span> their way to <span class="disease">carpal tunnel syndrome</span>, a<span class="disease"> painful wrist and hand disorder</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A small study found a link between extended use of <span class="object">smartphones</span> and other <span class="object">hand-held electronic devices</span> and a greater likelihood for experiencing the <span class="disease">telltale wrist and hand pain of the syndrome</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the researchers did not prove that heavy <span class="object">smartphone</span> use caused <span class="disease">carpal tunnel syndrome</span>, and one hand surgeon said very few people in the real world use their <span class="object">smartphones</span> as much as the heavy users in the study did.
            </p>

            <p>
                Study author Peter White said the findings suggest "caution may be warranted when using <span class="object">hand-held electronic devices</span>, in order to minimize the chance of developing <span class="disease">carpal tunnel syndrome</span>."
            </p>

            <div class="">
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY"></iframe>
            </div>
                
            <p>
                Carpal tunnel syndrome can gradually develop following repeated pressure to the point where the median nerve passes into the hand and meets the wrist.
              </p>

            <p>
                A common cause, said White, are work conditions that call for "repetitive, forceful or awkward hand movements, for example, when typing." And the result is often pain (sometimes extending up the arm), numbness, finger tingling and weakened grip strength.
              </p>

            <p>
                To explore whether smartphone use might up the carpal tunnel syndrome risk, White and his associates followed up on their prior investigation involving 500 Hong Kong University students.
              </p>

            <p>
                The researchers also found that intensive electronics users had "significantly" more discomfort, and more severe discomfort, in their wrist and hand.
            </p>

            <p>
                The more time a person spent using a hand-held electronic device, the more intense and long-lasting their wrist and hand pain was.
              </p>

            <p>
                To explain why, the researchers pointed to device design, which requires the repeated use of fingers to <span class="verb">click</span>, <span class="verb">swipe</span>, <span class="verb">scroll</span>, <span class="verb">tap</span> and press. The result is an enlargement and flattening of the median nerve, alongside bulging of a key ligament.
              </p>

            <p>
                To minimize risk, White advises keeping the wrist as straight as possible when using devices.
              </p>

            <p>
                He added, "One should try to minimize repetitive movements of one's fingers and thumb when using hand-held electronic devices, especially for single-hand use. It is also important to take regular rest periods, so as to avoid continuous intensive use, so as to allow recovery time and to prevent prolonged stress."
              </p>

            <p>
                Cage, who's with San Diego Hand Specialists, also suggested that "it is unlikely that the general population would have [the] degree of phone use" seen among the intensive users in the study.
              </p>

            <p>
                "This is likely an issue affecting only a small percentage of cellphone users," she said.
